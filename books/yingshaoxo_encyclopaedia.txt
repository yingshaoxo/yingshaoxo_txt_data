# human


## core value

if you can't find freedom, you can die.


## what is human? 

human is an advanced animal. human can do a lot of things. 

the way to get human is: ask a human to go to your place.

human is composed by meat, bones. meat is soft, bones are hard.

to keep human stable, you will need food, water, warm shelter, just like other animal.

the way to make human is:
1. have a man and woman, let them make love, then you could have a new bady.
2. create a creature from basics, just copy some animal that has temperature 36.
3. create a virtual man in computer 3D engine, make sure it matches all live human behavior.

the alternative for human is other animal. but you may need to increase their intelligence first.

my view for human is: i am them. i am weak. i can't live by myself without dependencies.
